# Recommendation-system-with-Java

Ever wonder how Netflix decides what movies to recommend for you? Or how Amazon recommends books? We can get a feel for how it works by building a simplified recommender of our own!
This is a capstone project for the course I took in Coursera.
Course Details can be found here - "https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming?"
This repository just includes the java classes that i used for building the a recommendation sytem of movies according to the matching tastes of any specific user.

In this, we will work with data for movies, including ratings, but the principles involved can easily be adapted to even books, restaurants, and more.A program to answer questions about the data, including which items should be recommended to a user based on their ratings of several movies. Given input files on users ratings and movie titles, you will be able to:
1. Read in and parse data into lists and maps; 
2. Calculate average ratings; 
3. Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings; and
4. Recommend movies to a given user based on ratings.
5. Display recommended movies for a given user on a webpage.
So, as of the above steps i have done upto step 4 ( the backend structure) and soon will create webpage for User Interface .
